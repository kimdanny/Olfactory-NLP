"It Wasn't Gas I Passed. The smell was in comparison to rotten eggs and the reason it is so memorable is because the source of the smell was coming from my mouth. I was in a small room full of people who assumed someone had released gas and was too embarrassed to fess up to the real source. Needless to say I called my mom to come and get me, and left as quickly as I could. I am sure they figured out the source once I was gone and it no longer smelled like that there.",cat8, Social interaction is affected by the smell,affecting,affected the social interaction/togetherness
"The Foul Litter box. Whenever I walked into my brother's apartment the smell hit me immediately. The entire living room was filled with the smell of urine and feces, and to a lesser extent the whole apartment. This smell emanated from the gigantic red litter pan sitting right beside the entranceway. Unfortunately, my brother's roommate had four adorable cats, but could never keep their litter pan clean. The smell deadened my senses and made me feel a bit dizzy. The urine was strong, and smelled like a noxious mix of chemicals. I smiled and tried not to gag. The cats were cute, but the stink was certainly not. I didn't mention it to him until later, because I knew that it was not his fault. I helped him drag in his belongings and tried to breathe through my mouth and not inhale. Eventually I had to, and I left the room in order to keep from retching. I still like cats, but I vow never to let my own cats' litter pan stink so terribly.",cat8, Social interaction is affected by the smell,affecting,affected the social interaction/togetherness
"I Can't Smell You. I, just tonight, had a coworker fart in my office before he left. After he left he came to my window and made a sniffing gesture as to ask if I smelled it yet. I acted like I didn't to keep him from having any satisfaction, but inside I was actually becoming quiet nauseated. I played it cool until he was gone and then I quickly ran for a bottle of air freshener. I sprayed the whole room down. The smell of his gas was the worse thing I have smelled in a long time; it really did just about make me puke.",cat8, Social interaction is affected by the smell,affecting,affected the social interaction/togetherness
Dragon Breath Teacher. Once a teacher yelled at me during class. She got so close up into my face that I could smell her bad breath.

The day I took a plunge. I was playing in a field with my friends when I tripped over a bush and fell into a pile of feces chest first. Instantly I could smell the pungent odor that escaped from it once I smashed it. It was smeared all over my chest and I was extremely embarrassed. I smelled terrible and the hot sun was only making me smell worse. This memory is still ingrained in my mind because of how humiliating it was.,cat8, Social interaction is affected by the smell,affecting,affected the social interaction/togetherness
"Eau d'Homeless (aka Why I Should Carry Febreze Around Everywher. I was riding the bus to work on what seemed like an ordinary, typical bus ride. I live in an urban area with a fair number of ragged looking homeless people that wander the streets night and day. At the next bus stop, a number of people got on and all of a sudden, I saw this really dirty looking homeless individual start walking down the aisle. You could smell the alcohol, the cigarettes, and the unmistakable musk of body odor wafting down the aisle several steps ahead of his physical presence. I was hoping and praying that he would not sit next to me, but he ended up plopping down right next to me for the rest of the bus ride. I wanted to gag and really felt like throwing up - the smell was that bad and no open window and fresh breeze could rectify such a stink. I decided to get off at the next stop and wait for the next bus, even though that would possibly make me a little late for work.",cat8, Social interaction is affected by the smell,affecting,affected the social interaction/togetherness

People. I attended a seminar in which I had to work in teams consisting of people from different nations.  I cannot forget the smell of the representatives from two countries in Asia.

"Accidental compliments. I washed my clothes with Tide Sport and it has a very strong scent. I didn't know how much to use with my clothes so I used too much and they smelled really strongly of that smell, but I liked the smell alot because it smelled good to me, but to everyone else it was very strong. So I walked about campus alot and people would give me compliments on how good I smelled.

B&C Incense. This was the last day of filming on the project.  We were in a large sound stage working with green screen.  I walked over to the video monitors to check something out and could smell the incense burning.  The musty odor always makes me sneeze so I walked away quickly.  After a while the scent started to overtake the table I was working out and the sneezing started.  I asked around to try to find out where it was coming from and why someone decided to burn it.  I had to leave my position for the rest of the day because I could not stop sneezing and it was affecting the filming.  I was devastated that I could not finish my job.,cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
"The thousand dollar smell.. A few years ago we were shopping for a car for my spouse. We found one we really liked at a local dealer, and had to think about it before we tried to deal on it. But, the dealer had just recently had their parking lot resurfaced. Something about that fresh blacktop material really affected me. It was either the smell that I noticed with much more clarity than my spouse, or something in it that caused an allergic reaction. Whatever, I didn't want to have to deal with that experience again. We tried to get the dealer to work out some details about an offer over the phone, explaining that I couldn't stand to be in their newly resurfaced parking lot. They wouldn't deal that way, so we called around and found a dealer in a town some 70 miles away that had the same car. We bought it there.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
"The Overwhelming Odor of Hops. I was pregnant with my daughter and passed by a restaurant that brews it's own beer. As I neared the restaurant I was overwhelmed with the smell of beer, not beer that's in a glass, but the hops that makes the beer. I'd passed by this same place for years and never had a problem. I had to cross the street to get as far away from the smell as possible.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
"Pungent Supermarket Smell. I guess one of the most memorable smells that I can recall to date would be the smell of Fiesta supermarkets. Walking into the stores is like getting a bombardment of freshness, but not a good freshness. That is because the chemical they use to clean their stores smells like brand new disposable diapers. And the smell is not light so it is like getting bitch slapped with this pungent chemical smell. A complete turn off, one of the reasons that I do not shop there.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
Cat Crap... Ohhh that smell!!!. I have three cats and taking care of their litter boxes is always an unpleasant job. A friend had purchased a bag of cat litter for soaking up an oil spill in her driveway and didn't need the rest of the bag so she brought it to me. It was a different brand than I usually use. I put it in the litter box the last time I scooped it and yesterday when I did my usual maintenance scooping I was surprised that the smell was not as strong as it had been in the past. Maybe it's time to switch brands.,cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
"Saved by the Smell!. Among many things in my sexual-personal dating life, smell really impacted me. Although I'm only twenty, I found out quickly that smell is important to me. My ex-boyfriend and current boyfriend alike had rather pleasant smells to me. I remember in high school, I was complementing a boyfriend and met this boy that was nice and sweet. The only downside or so I thought was that the smell wasn't so pleasant to my nose. I hated it so much that it put a bad taste in my mouth. Whether that was... a mean choice or not to choose based off smell, I did it and didn't date the guy. Reflecting on it, I'm realllllly glad that I chose against dating the guy even if it was something so silly as smell. Not long after that I found out through a mutual friend and on the news that the guy had murdered his minor girlfriend's father just to stay with her and keep her because she was in earl stages of pregnancy.

"Accidental vegetarian. I was pregnant, so I was very sensitive to smells at the time. On this particular occasion I was cooking ground beef.

Smell of death. I remember the smell of a nursing home.  It was a very stale negative smell in my opinion.

"The Aroma that Recollects an Antecedent Amigo (?). I have memories connected with the scent of Tresemme's Anti-Breakage shampoo. Many times when I smell it, I think of an old friend---who is no longer a friend---from high school to early college. He was my best friend, and I was at his house a lot. I became really close with his family. One day, while showering there, I used this shampoo, and for some reason, I really enjoyed the scent. Since then, I introduced it to my parents and they bought it when I was still living with them, and now I purchase it for myself and my fiancee in our apartment.  I don't think of my old friend every time I use it, since it's so frequent now, but on occasion, I still do---sometimes more often than others. The scent doesn't really conjure up good or bad memories initially, but it can trek to either eventually, depending upon where the initial memory is led.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour
"Bread in the oven. The first time I ever made my own bread was a revelation. I was unemployed, and it was something I had always wanted to try. No time like the present, and it would save some money as well. I love fresh bread.    The first time I made bread, the smell was transformative. The flour and yeast smells in the kitchen were fun, but a bit of time later, my apartment was filled with the smell of fresh bread. It was a smell I had loved since I was a kid, but had never had it as strong as when it was in my own kitchen and wafting through the rest of the house.    I was hooked. I began to love doing all the cooking at home, and that turned into a major turnaround in our family's health and budget. Eventually, with the birth of my son, we realized that I was actually more suited to being the stay-at-home parent, and my wife continued her career. All because of the smell of fresh bread.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my behaviour

"Comforting sweater scent. My old grirfriend used to wash her clothes in Tide detergent, so they, especially her sweaters, had a particular smell on them when fresh.

"White Lilac Sheets. My brother arrived at my home to help me move the bed from the guest room into the master bedroom.  He had to help me do that because my husband had taken our king size bed with him when he left earlier that day.  I actually helped him load the u-haul and hated myself for not letting him struggle.  The bed was moved easily, it was my old bed, the one I bought for myself when I left him.  It had a lovely and romantic brass headboard and seeing it in the room made me feel a bit better.  The walls had already been freshly painted.  I just needed to wash my sheets and make my bed and the room would be mine. Only mine.  I used my expensive white lilac laundry detergent to wash the sheets and covers.  When they came out of the dryer the sheets smelled like home and comfort.  I made the bed with my lilac sheets and the atmosphere changed.  I still remember that scent and how I felt on that day.  I was going to be okay.  The room didn't look or feel or smell lonely anymore.  It looked and smelled fresh and clean and lovely and a bit romantic and it was mine.",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,has been used to change the mood
"The Road to Sous Chef. I remember the first day working in the kitchen at a sports bar. There was a combination of smells, all easily distinguishable.

"Thanksgiving smells of childhood. I am one of 5 front of house managers at a nice restaurant. Last year, a week before Thanksgiving, one of our managers had a family emergency while another was on vacation. I ended up working four 15-hour workdays in a row as a result. On the last day, in the last hour I was there, exhausted and completely drained mentally and emotionally, our chef started prep work for the big Thanksgiving dinner service we were doing. My office is back near the prep kitchen, and suddenly it was full of the smells of roasting turkey, savory stuffing, basting hams...it was amazing, and reminded me of happy Thanksgivings of my childhood and the smells coming out of my mother's kitchen.  It was an incredibly comforting, cathartic, and altogether wonderful smell...I'll always associate it with the relief of finishing that grueling work period (and then the accompanying 4 days in a row off work).",cat9," Smell changes mood, attitude and behavior",changing,made me change my mood
"Get Home to a Wonderful Meal. I was having a really long day at work and am always hungry when I get home. I'm usually on the border between just hungry and cranky from hunger. I get home, walk through the door, and a wonderful smell hits my nose. It was a combination of fresh baked bread, a meaty aroma, and joy. Joy because after weeks of coming home in not the best mood, my boyfriend finally realized something he could do to make it better.

Laughing with Cookies. I remember walking into our kitchen and seeing my mom scooping cookies out of a bowl onto to the pan.

Airplane Odor. I hate to travel and one thing I hate about it is the smell of airplanes. I hate that they are stuffy and stale. They smell like really old coffee which I hate the smell of anyway and stale is the worst. They also smell like that mixed with a outhouse and some kind of spray mixed in to try and cover up the smell of the bathroom. All of that mixed together just makes my stomach roll. I feel sick the entire time I am on a airplane. It makes the entire experience seem to take that much longer and feeling sick for hours is no fun mixed with the odor makes it horrible.,cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a location

"Frosting Donuts. The smell of a donut shop, or donuts in general bring to mind memories of when my parents owned a bakery.  I was 12-14 years old.  They made me work in the bakery after school frosting donuts.  It was awful.  The job itself wasn't bad, but the other employees made me uncomfortable.  And after a few minutes inside the bakery the donuts stop smelling delicious.  They take on this sickeningly sweet yeasty smell.  And  after working there for more than a half an hour, the smell starts permeating into your clothes and hair.  Even to this day, donuts are very unappealing to me because it brings back those feelings of loss of freedom, not feeling safe (older men working there made me feel unsafe), and overall unhappiness.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a negative event/episode
"The smell of an Ex. My scent memory has to do with a cologne worn by an ex boy friend, we had been friends for a while and I came to associate this specific scent with him. Things in our relationship did not end well, one might even say very badly. Weeks maybe even months later is when I first encountered this cologne being worn by someone else. Instantly I associated the smell with my ex and all the feelings from our messy break up came flooding back all at once. Even now, years later, I am completely over what happened between us but if I smell that cologne it still brings back the way I felt the first time I smelled it after our breakup.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a negative event/episode

The smell was present when you entered the front door and it got stronger as you got further into the residents quarters.  Now whenever I go to a nursing home and smell that smell I am instantly transported back to my first visit to see my mom on that day.

"Funnel Cakes of Joy. My childhood wasn't the greatest. My mom is and was an abusive alcoholic, I didn't and don't know my father, and my mother had multiple abusive men coming in and out of our home a lot. She kept us secluded out in the countryside and refused to drive us to the city. Kids my age were scarce and hard to come by and the kids at my school were not the friendliest of people. In fact, I was one of the only white kids, so I was constantly bullied. We were poor and didn't have the internet or video games or even cable. The only thing that I could ever really do was to play out in the woods by myself.     This went on for a few years until one day when I was out in the woods playing, I heard two other kids talking and walking around. Anyways, long story short, it was a brother and sister named Justin and Jessica. Their family basically adopted me and I was constantly at their house spending the night. They knew about my home life and tried their best to give me a childhood.

The smell of the car the first time I set in it reminded me of my achievement.,cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,coupled to achievement/success
"New Beginnings. My house in the summer always smells prominently of wood. When I was growing up, our house was not made of wood, so it's not something I always experienced growing up; it was only when I moved out of my college dorm and into my first apartments in older buildings that I started to experience this. The smell goes away in the fall and returns in the spring, but whenever I smell it, I think of when I first moved in and was starting my post college life.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a new beginning

"The old asylum. The Trans Allegheny Lunatic Asylum is a building that is over 150 years old, it no longer tends to patients, instead has been turned into a museum/attraction of sorts. I am one of their paranormal themed tour guides. The very first time I'd ever been in, the scent of the place was almost overwhelming- a musty, dated smell with a hint of moisture. The entire main building carries this smell, even with the renovations like new painting. Recalling how it smells, recalls other memories from within the building.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a location

The wonderful scents of food on the Boardwalk.. I arrived at the boardwalk on the beach and immediately noticed a very enticing smell of food cooking. It was a combination of grilled meat and fried foods and was very heavy in the air. I was there to eat at a restaurant and was very hungry. The smell in the air made my mouth water and made me acutely aware of being hungry.

"The smells of Paris. I often spent my holidays in Paris. My grandmother lived there. Three smells always stood out in my memory. Whenever I get a whiff of french fries of fresh baked bread I am transported to lunch time in the streets of Paris. every time I walked the streets of Paris, any street, the unavoidable scent of freshly fried french fries was in the air. It was a heavenly scent and always very appetizing. In the mornings, very early, you could smell the fresh baked bread and croissants in the air coming from all the little bakeries. But the first thing one smells, that always makes me say to myself  yep! This is Paris!  is at the airport. As soon as I open the doors that lead outside the Airport Charles de Gaulle, you can smell the fumes coming from all the cars! Who would have thought that the scent of pollution and carbon monoxide would be one's first indication that he or she has arrived at the city of lights? But it's true. Take a trip there and you'll know I'm right. Every time, over the course of 30 years, I am reminded of Paris when I scent these smells.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a location

"The Tunnel Under Vine Street Elementary School. It may sound strange, but outside of Vine Street Elementary School in Los Angeles (built in 1912 and still in use), there was a TUNNEL you would use to cross the street, to avoid getting run over (although I suppose in that dark tunnel there was always the possibility of murder). Anyways, when it would not rain for many days in Los Angeles, and then it did rain, the sidewalks gave off a wonderful smell (to me) : a dark, earthy aroma of rain hitting the scorching hot pavement in a low-humidity atmosphere. It was very much like dark, black, top soil on a prosperous farm. I LOVED that smell, and it was not at all like the awful, humid, suffocating copper beer yeast STINK of Milwaukee! Walking through that tunnel (in 1968-1972) was a wonderful experience because of that scent, and feeling of history. That was my favorite smell I can think of, with cigar boxes being second, or perhaps the ocean at Santa Monica, California being second!",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a positive event/episode

The smell of the hot concrete that had just been hosed off combined with the chlorine in the pool and the sunscreen on my skin is vivid as I remember how scared I was to learn that new dive.

I was happy back then.  That smell brings me back to that time.  There have been other times since that time 20 years where I smelled some sort of smell that was somewhat similar to that smell and it struck up these memories.

"The Smell of the House. This past winter I went up to the Catskills with some family friends.  These friends had recently bough a big house up in the mountains from their grandmother, after she moved to a smaller place.  I stepped in the house and was immediately greeted by a distinct smell.    It was the kind of scent you would smell when you were inside a tent or an old cabin - a thick, musty aroma that reminds one of the deep woods or of camping.  I know some people that don't like it, but personally I love the smell.    The whole house smelled like this - the furniture, the bedrooms, even the water had a faint trace of it.  And I loved it.    I knew that the week that we were staying in the house would be fun from the moment I stepped inside.  I was surrounded by some of my best friends, we had a ton of great food and a bunch of games, and we were prepared to do nothing but relax and have fun all week.  In the end, I was right - I treasure the memories of that week.    Sometimes I'll catch a whiff of that smell.  Maybe I'll be in the attic and find some old pillows.  Maybe I'll be taking a sleeping bag out of the closet.

Still thinking back to this day brings back very fond memories.",cat1,Associating the past with a smell,connecting,linked to a positive life event
"Hearty Marinara vs Regular Pizza Sauce: How I Tell The Differen. I used to work for Domino's and there are a few different sauces we can put on pizzas.  The Hearty Marinara and regular pizza sauces look kind of the same (the former is a bit more chunky if I remember right), but they smell different.  The Marinara has a smell that I actively dislike, while I'm good with the regular sauce.  One night, we were busy, making lots of pizzas, when two identical pizzas came out of the oven, one with the Marinara and one with the regular sauce.  The driver didn't know how to tell them apart, so I came over and smelled them and pointed at the one who's smell was not good and told him that was the one with the Marinara.  So, because of the fact that I don't actually like that sauce, it makes it easier for me to tell pizzas with identical toppings apart if one has that sauce and the other does not, so that the customers can get the product they ordered rather than have a mix-up occur.  I did that more than once, too, by telling identically topped pizzas apart by the sauce smell.  It made me proud that I actually had some use beside being good on the phones and gave my disliking of the Marinara a good point!",cat5, Smell allowing identification and detection,enabling,helped me to identify it
"Don't forget to check your gas stove before you leave the house. When I was in college. I had an apartment with a gas stove.

"No candles!. One of the most memorable smell experiences I've ever had involved walking in to a candle shop in the mall. I often refuse to go in to them because the smells can cause me to have allergies, but I braved the storm so that my girlfriend could look around. For me, there always appears to be a certain smell in candles and fragrances that immediately upon smelling I can identify as something that will cause allergy issues for me. It's a pungent smell that excites my nose in all the wrong ways. The smell almost feels like the start of a sneeze. Unfortunately, often those smells will cause allergy issues that can persist for hours. In this instance, my generosity caused me to be miserable for the rest of the venture.",cat5, Smell allowing identification and detection,enabling,helped me to identify it
"the smell in the NICU. My son was born 6 wees early, so had to spend some time in the NICU.  I was discharged from the hospital after a day and a half, but he was in for another 12 days.  I would go visit him (change him, nurse him, cuddle him) at least twice a day, every day.  Maybe it was just an association with the smell of  hospital , but I swear the postpartum hormones were so strong that I could smell him from the moment I walked in the doors.  I used to joke with my husband that I could be led into the NICU blindfolded and find my baby on the first go.

I had commented to my teacher that it was the particular brand that it was, and he seemed impressed that I was right and had identified it by smell alone. I remember feeling very smart at the time and a little bit special that my teacher was so impressed.

I ended up just following the smell and looking around as the smell was so amazing that it led me to the place.  When I went in, I was amazed at how great the pizza smelled and I hoped the pizza smelled as great as it was.

"Really--A Skunk?. I remember the first time I smelled a skunk. Honestly, I can't understand why skunks have a reputation for such foul odors. I agree that the smell was unpleasant, but it wasn't exactly gag-inducing. It reminded me more of burning rubber, but not the type of burning rubber you would associate with tires. This was much more subtle, and it even had a hint of dawn air about it (the skunks around here seem to be nocturnal creatures).",cat10, Smell builds up and changes expectations,expecting,surprised me

They place the wings in front of me and the smell of the ghost pepper sauce put tears in my eyes. Fear set in, and everyone knew it was going to be bad. The smell wreaked of all the things you know you have t drown in ranch dressing just to choke down. The smell was but a mere warning for the taste, which left me crying for over an hour.

I almost felt my nose becoming runny and took out a tissue. When I tasted the dish, however, the taste wasn't nearly as sour as I expected it to be from the smell.

There was no air conditioning and it was a warm day in June, so the stink pervaded the place and seemed to envelop me and seep into my pores. For days afterwards, I couldn't shake the smell.

The smell of the dissection lab is one that I don't think anyone will ever forget. It doesn't smell like decay, it smells like formaldehyde mixed with some kind of spearmint like scent. I think they added that scent to make the formaldehyde less strong smelling, but in actuality I think it made it worse. To this day, anytime I smell spearmint, it takes me back to those days and makes me feel somewhat nauseous, even though I was never nauseous during dissection lab!

A few seconds later I heard rustling and saw another dog come out of the bushes with two other dogs.... They look emaciated and somewhat wild, but you could tell they used to be housepets....They didn't pay much attention to me after they realized I wasn't a threat. I slowly backed away from them and went the opposite direction while making sure they weren't following me.... While I backed away, I saw them mourning their companion, nudging the deceased with their noses, licking and whimpering, as if guarding the body, so no one, or no thing will touch it....

The doctor told me to count backwards from 10 and I remember getting to 9. I was fine after that, of course. But to me that smell was the smell of terror and death.

The entire trip to Japan was absolutely perfect but this was a strange experience for me.",cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,overwhelmed me
"Hobo. I was in France backpacking with a friend. We had to go underground to catch the train, and as we came to the top of the stairs, an overwhelming odor caught us by surprise. It was horrible and smelled as if something was decaying.     It turned out to be a human being, homeless, asleep. I'm not certain to this day if he was dead or alive, but I'll never forget what I saw and I will certainly never forget gagging as we ran for our train.",cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,overwhelmed me
Worst Smell Ever. I was working in a laboratory and there was a clear liquid on the countertop. I walked past it and it was a putrid smell. It was and still is the worst smelling thing that I have ever dealt with. It turns out to be a sulfur based compound so the smell of rotten eggs was strong. I did not like it and my nose was stuffed for the rest of the day.,cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,overwhelmed me
"Old odor. Walking into an elderly retirement home I remember being overcome by the smell of old people. I don't know what it was exactly but it was there. It could be described as a stuffy hot feeling except instead of humidity it was just old age. I do not what exactly this scent was, but it was undeniable. It was like walking into the hot sun on a summer day from being in an air conditioned place.",cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,overwhelmed me
The horrid smell. When we first moved to our house just down the road there is a sewer plant. The smell was horrid and took weeks to get used to.

"smoldering. The smell of burning wood. It gets me every time. When I was seven years old our house burned down. On Christmas Eve. On the coldest winter day on record for where I lived. They were building a new fire station to be ready January 1. The next door neighbor alerted us to the fire. My mom more or less threw me out the door with a coat and started getting everyone else out. I watched it burn from across the street and didn't speak for the next two weeks, instead drawing pictures of fire (or so I've been told). It's been thirty years and yet it all comes back every single time I smell a log burning.",cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,traumatized me
"Orange Blossoms in the Night. In the 1980s, there was still a fair amount of agricultural land being farmed in the county where I live.  It was late spring and warm enough for me to be driving on the freeway with my window open.  I was focused on driving safely and was paying attention primarily to things on the freeway.  Suddenly, I smelled orange blossoms!  It was so unexpected.  I didn't expect to smell something like that while driving fast or in the dark.  I didn't even know there were orange trees in that location.  That scent memory reminds me of being in my 20s and having grown up in a county where oranges were a primary fruit harvested.  I have never smelled that again.",cat6, Overwhelming power of smell,hitting/shocking,overwhelmed me

We couldn't pinpoint where exactly the smell was coming from because it smelled so disgusting. After a few minutes of looking around, we stumbled upon a rotting deer carcass. The flesh was blue and green and it was covered in creepy bugs. I couldn't get any closer than five feet since the odor was so powerful. I have no idea how long it was sitting there for, but it was quite for a while. The carcass was the single worst thing I've ever smelled.

"Fetal pig preservatives. In high school we had to dissect fetal pigs for my anatomy class. As soon as all the pigs were brought out, the room became filled with the stench of a preservative. It was a god-awful smell that was really in a class of its own; it smelled like overly powerful cleaning product mixed with pig, and cut open pigs everywhere didn't make the situation any more bearable. I had to to plug my nose a lot of the time, but for weeks and weeks, the smell lingered in the class room, hitting everyone hard the moment they walked in. The smell was so powerful that at times out of class, it would randomly feel like I was smelling it, and that happened for a good half of a year.",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded public space
The customer may be right but the stench isn't.. I work in a coffee shop. And let's just say a certain regular customer was quite odiferous. We weren't exactly sure what the smell was but it didn't smell like B.O. but we weren't sure if it was his work or something he put on himself to make himself smell like that. His smell would linger in the shop for hours afterwards and would make several of us workers feel nauseous and give us headaches. I think our boss finally had words with him or something since he no longer comes to our store. But that is one of the worst smell experiences I have ever had.,cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded public space
"E's Nasty Room. When I was a freshman in college, my neighbor in the dorms was a strange guy. He was nice enough, but tended to keep to himself. He lived in a single, where most rooms had a double situation. But what I did remember about him was that everytime he would open his door. This awful stale odor would permeate the hallways and the lounge and basically cause a forced evacuation for all the other students. It wasn't the smell of rotting food or bad hygeine, but it was some strange chemical, sour smell that I'd be able to pick out immediately if I smelt it again years later. We were never sure what caused the smell, just that it was so identifiable.",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded public space

"Skunky Dogs. I had just returned from picking up dinner and we could hardly eat any of it because the house smelled so horrible.  I guessed the dogs had startled a skunk that had gotten under the house and the smell was coming through the floor. The smell stayed very strong throughout the evening. Later on, we were watching a movie in bed with the dogs (they like to burrow under the covers) and when I moved the cover I was hit with a huge dose of skunk. It was the dogs and they must have taken a direct hit! By now it was in my bed and on all the furniture.  We looked up all the recipes for getting rid of the skunk smell and tried most of them, both homemade and stuff we got from the vet.  It took over a week to get most of the smell out of the house and every time the dogs got wet, it was back with a vengeance. It was probably a good month before it was completely gone. My research led me to conclude that there are two kinds of dogs...those that learn from their first encounter with a skunk and those that NEVER do. Thankfully we seem to have the first kind of dogs. :)",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded private space
"Don't want to smell that twice!. I woke up one morning suddenly confused and was hit with an odor so horrible I couldn't figure out what it was. My first thought was something was burning but my husband came up the stairs saying it was a skunk under the porch. It was not like the smell you get a whiff of when a skunk stinks up the outdoors, no this was something so incredibly overwhelming. My dog wouldn't eat his breakfast and I had to take it outdoors before he would eat or drink. It was impossible to stay inside. We opened all the windows and doors, plugging in fans everywhere and went out to our shop behind the house to spend the day. The smell lingered for hours.",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded private space
"Accident at the Door.. About two years ago, my wife and I woke up around four in the morning to an awful, room encompassing smell. It was immediately clear that something awful had happened, as we began to hold our breaths since simple breathing was causing us to gag. We reached for the light and turned it on, and there it was: our dog had had an accident right next to the door. Right in front of the door, in fact, so we could not even quickly open the door to escape the smell because then the door would spread the accident and make things even worse. Between gags, we brainstormed what we could do to exit the room and acquire the cleaning products we needed. Simply opening the door was not an option since the accident was right next to it and the door opened inwards. After what seemed like an eternity, we found some folders and papers in the room that we could do without, and we used this to brush the accident aside so that we could open the door and get the cleaning materials required. We went through with cleaning and disposing of it, but we were unable to go back to sleep and the smell haunted us throughout the day.",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded private space
"Skunk Stink. I was riding my bicycle along a path by a local country club, lots of brush and trees.  Suddenly I came to an area when there was the strong odor of a skunk that apparently had just sprayed and the whole area smelled to high heaven.  I turned around immediately off the path but I must have brushed against the bushes where the skunk had sprayed and gotten it on myself (skin) clothing and bike.  I smelled for days and it was the most pungent, horrible stench I had ever been exposed to.  My bike still has a faint smell to it; the smell is still on the tires I think.",cat7, Smell invading private and public space,invading,invaded private space
"Sewer backup. One day when I went into my mother's house after we had been out for several hours and the house had been closed up I thought I smelled a bad smell when I was in the kitchen. I didn't listen to my intuition and couldn't find the source, so I didn't investigate any further. The next day I walked into the pantry beyond the kitchen and noticed the smell again. This time I decided to go into the basement and it got worse. I kept walking until I got to the bathroom and then I saw that there was a backup and the shower was full of sewage. When I took off my shoes in order to clean I realized that it had backed up halfway through the basement and the carpet was soaked. The smell was horrible and I was really worried that we wouldn't be able to get rid of it. But I bought some carpet cleaner and powders and vacuumed and ran the fans to dry it out and the smell seems to have gone away.

They were REALLY dirty. Like, their apartment consistently smelled of garbage and cigarettes. It was this kind of rotting pizza + feces + cigarette smell + weed smell that at first was really really strong, and you see once you live there you get used to it. My room was really clean so it didn't smell like that, but when you left my room, even though I couldn't really notice it anymore because we became used to it, the smell still sort of lingered, like the burning sensation in the nose?

"Candles gone wrong.. My sister gave me a lot of very small jars of scented wax. They weren't candles, since they didn't have wicks. They were also about two inches tall with the diameter of a quarter, so very small. I set a few around my room to see if they'd freshen it up, and put a coffee scented one in my car. It was summer, and I park my car outside. Of course, the wax melted and I didn't realize it. I tended to take turns pretty fast and often cut the curb on my right turns when I started driving. This caused the melted wax to spill all over. What was at first a nice, pleasant fresh smell now coated my entire dashboard, enough to start to make me dizzy. I had to pull over and stand outside with my windows down to try and vent some of it out and eliminate my starting headache.

The pressure cooker was rattling and hissing, shaking violently on the stove as it processed this most heinous concoction. Then my mom got out the corned beef, which made me want to retch.

"The Ingrained Scent. I was at work one morning when I passed by a coworker who was new. I saw her out of the corner of my eye but was focusing on talking to someone so I didn't look over. As she passed me I caught a whiff of vanilla. My senses quickly woke up. Not because it was a new scent but the way it worked for her it smelled so good. I turned my head, inhaled a bit more.

"The Smell of Cologne. The memorable smell experience that comes to mind for me would have to be walking into our local store and trying out different brands of cologne in order to find one that fit me just right. The sniff is almost indescribable because they smell so addicting that it's more of a  you have to be there  type feeling, but what helps is that it's your nose's first time smelling any of them, thus the aroma overwhelms you and draws you closer and closer. As you use it more and more, the smell still sticks around, but not as prevalent as that first time when you're spraying it on your wrist to test it out. The one I prefer the most is called  Raw Power  and it really takes your breath away with how hypnotically incredible the smell is that first time.",cat3, Smell perceived as stimulating,pleasing,first time perfume scent

I didn't think much about it. Later when I returned home, I finished the stick of deodorant and went back to my usual brand. A year or so later, I received another coupon for that type deodorant. I purchased it again and upon opening it for the first use, the scent took me immediately back to my Hawaiian vacation. It was surprising and wonderful.

While I didn't remember many of the details of the museum itself, the smell brought back the feelings of joy that I had as a child when I visited there with my mom.

More recently, since more Targets have a Starbucks in them, it includes the smell of coffee. We would walk around the store for a while and then, on the way home, stop at Taco Bell to eat, where we always had lots of laughs.

I'm not talking about the difference in pollution levels, or car exhaust or anything like that (although those are big differences). What strikes me, however, is that in China, they use different brands of cleaners. Office buildings and restaurants smell different - not bad, just different. Bathrooms in china will smell differently because they use a different deordorant. I was back in the States one summer eating with friends at a Chinese restaurant. They must have imported their cleaners from China or gotten it at an Asian SUpermarket, but when I walked into their bathroom to wash my hand, I was so struck by the smell, and thought I was in Asia for a brief moment.",cat2, Remembering through a smell,remembering,triggered a flashback

He came to visit me several times in the space of a few weeks, and we spent a lot of time talking in the stairwells of my dorm room where a certain cleaning product was used daily.   It didn't last.  I'd graduated and moved on, when I walked into a building (I think it was a store) that used the same cleaning product. And suddenly it was September of my freshman year at college, and I was in the stairwell again with that young man. The smell of the cleaning product - medicinal, sort of sweet and soapy, mingled with the smell of his skin. I could feel the autumn evening weather I associated so strongly with our relationship. I could see the rubber stair treads on the stairwell, and I remembered with intense acuity the strength of my infatuation. It was an instant flood of sensation and memory.",cat2, Remembering through a smell,remembering,triggered a flashback
"The wafting of a lost love. My ex-girlfriend from college had a particular perfume that she wore. While I was dating her, I suppose I didn't notice it that much. However, I was recently going through some old boxes and opened one that had some of her things in it. The smell hit me and it immediately brought back memories from when we were in our old apartment back in college. I'd say it was a bittersweet experience for that to come rushing back.",cat2, Remembering through a smell,remembering,triggered a flashback
"Natural Scents. When I was a child, about 7, I went with my grandmother to her acupuncturist. While I was there I encountered wonderful natural, earthy, herbal combination of scents, probably oils, used for massage in the acupuncturist practice. As an adult, I came across a very similar scent sold in a little blue bottle at bath and body works, it was an aromatherapie product, an oil that is the only smell to come close to this scent that I otherwise really can't describe though continue to seek out.",cat4, Smell creating desire for more,stimulating,made me fancy something

"The Scent of Moving On. One of the most memorable smells I've had to date was the odor that permeated the funeral home my grandmother was prepared in. The sharp semi-acidic tang of the embalming fluids combined with the plethora of babies breath flowers and other heavily scented objects in the room. You could pick out the alcoholic perfume they had picked out to mask the scent of a decaying cadaver as well as the scent of whatever they used to sterilize the floors. The way they combined put together a rather odd feeling related to those smells, one of  this is where everything ends.  It was one of those scents that rampantly remind one of their own mortality and just how many other people had gone through this exact same process beforehand. It was, after reflecting on it, the smell of moving on.",cat4, Smell creating desire for more,stimulating,triggered reflection

"Amazing Cologne. One amazing smell experience that I remember was when I went on my first date with a guy that I had met a few days earlier. He had on this really great smelling cologne.

"The lure of the Demel Cafe. As I walked through Vienna and was outside the Demel Cafe, a strong but incredible smell of fresh pastries and coffee and cherries brought me in.  I had been to a lot of bakeries, but none that smelled (and as I later found tasted) this good.  The pastry smell was of butter and dough and was the most dominant.  The smell of high quality strong coffees was secondary, not nearly as strong as the smell of pastries but still quite apparent.  The smell of cherries was tertiary and was somewhat faint but still discernable.  I was salivating before I entered what would be one of the greatest eating experiences of my life.",cat4, Smell creating desire for more,stimulating,made me do something
"The Aroma of Sweet Mexico. A memorable experience involving smell is when I moved to a new neighborhood and I was walking down the street to do a little shopping for household goods when I smelled something so sweat and stomach pulling that I had to find out where it was coming from. It turned out to be a Mexican bakery that was a block away. I looked through the window at all of the pastries on display. I spotted something that I wanted to try so I went inside. There were a lot of customers inside with trays of different pastries piled up, literally. I ordered the Mexican pastry and it smelled amazing too. I bit into it and it tasted amazing, even better than it smelled. It was so decadent that I had to go back and get another. Now everytime that I go around that part of town, that aroma pulls me into that bakery for some pastries.",cat4, Smell creating desire for more,stimulating,made me do something

"The Sweet Smell of CPU. A few of years ago I saved up the money to buy a high-end computer which I would build myself. I didn't expect any smell from the experience of putting the parts together, but there was a very distinct odor about all the parts as I unboxed them and carefully put them into place. There was the smell of the cardboard boxes it all arrived in, the smell of new metal--perhaps it was a combination of these and other things, but when the building was complete there was just a singular smell that was unique to a new computer built by my own hands. It smelled new, powerful even.

"Sunday Lunch with my Italian Great Aunt. The moment I am choosing to focus on is the smell of homemade italian food being cooked by my great aunt on a Sunday afternoon for family lunch. The smell of tomato sauce in particular is a pretty perverse smell that permeates the house.  It is a combination of tomato and the aromatic spices of garlic,basil and oregano.  Most people hate the smell of garlic but I think it smells delicious especially when fried. Thinking of the experience simulates a hungry reflex in me as the food is always delicious.

After taking over 10 hours to get a ride to the gas station, then getting a ride back to my car, then finally reaching a small town - I walked out and the smell of fresh barbecued ribs from the local BBQ shack in town came wafting into my nose.  I was smitten; my mouth was watering; I hadn't eaten all day and it was a particularly stressful one.  I have never has such a viceral response to food before, and I couldn't contain myself.

The smell would make the entire restaurant feel like it was full of delicious bread. It would make your mouth water the entire afternoon because of how great the place smelled.

It was the most incredible perfume that I had ever smelled.  It smelled like a combination of fruit, flowers, and one other distinct scent that I am still unable to put my finger on.  I had never smelled a perfume like that one in my life.  This sounds weird, but I just stood there and inhaled deeply a few times because the smell was so incredible.

I was twenty-five, so obviously I already knew what coffee smelled like, but I had never known it could smell so *good* (alas, I had not yet been to Portland, but that's another story). They roast on-premises there, and the scent of freshly-roasted coffee beans and lovingly crafted espresso was so much richer and more complex than the coffee smells I had been used to that it could scarcely be considered the same experience. The inside of a Starbucks smelled dead, but this smell was alive, sparkling with notes of spice and sweetness I had never associated with coffee before. I ordered an espresso, and inhaling the scent rising from the cup itself was the same experience, but an order of magnitude greater, the sort of aroma that drowns out all your other senses for one heavenly moment.",cat4, Smell creating desire for more,stimulating,caused an aha-moment
