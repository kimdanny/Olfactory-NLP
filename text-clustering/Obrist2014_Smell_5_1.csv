My mom is and was an abusive alcoholic, I didn't and don't know my father, and my mother had multiple abusive men coming in and out of our home a lot. She kept us secluded out in the countryside and refused to drive us to the city. Kids my age were scarce and hard to come by and the kids at my school were not the friendliest of people. In fact, I was one of the only white kids, so I was constantly bullied. We were poor and didn't have the internet or video games or even cable. The only thing that I could ever really do was to play out in the woods by myself.     This went on for a few years until one day when I was out in the woods playing, I heard two other kids talking and walking around.

They knew about my home life and tried their best to give me a childhood. With the exception of maybe two times, every single Friday night, we would all go to the drive-in movie theatre and eat funnel cakes.

I was happy back then.  That smell brings me back to that time.  There have been other times since that time 20 years where I smelled some sort of smell that was somewhat similar to that smell and it struck up these memories.

I stepped in the house and was immediately greeted by a distinct smell.    It was the kind of scent you would smell when you were inside a tent or an old cabin - a thick, musty aroma that reminds one of the deep woods or of camping.  I know some people that don't like it, but personally I love the smell.    The whole house smelled like this - the furniture, the bedrooms, even the water had a faint trace of it.  And I loved it.    I knew that the week that we were staying in the house would be fun from the moment I stepped inside.  I was surrounded by some of my best friends, we had a ton of great food and a bunch of games, and we were prepared to do nothing but relax and have fun all week.  In the end, I was right - I treasure the memories of that week.    Sometimes I'll catch a whiff of that smell.  Maybe I'll be in the attic and find some old pillows.  Maybe I'll be taking a sleeping bag out of the closet.

The Hearty Marinara and regular pizza sauces look kind of the same (the former is a bit more chunky if I remember right), but they smell different.  The Marinara has a smell that I actively dislike, while I'm good with the regular sauce.  One night, we were busy, making lots of pizzas, when two identical pizzas came out of the oven, one with the Marinara and one with the regular sauce.  The driver didn't know how to tell them apart, so I came over and smelled them and pointed at the one who's smell was not good and told him that was the one with the Marinara.  So, because of the fact that I don't actually like that sauce, it makes it easier for me to tell pizzas with identical toppings apart if one has that sauce and the other does not, so that the customers can get the product they ordered rather than have a mix-up occur.  I did that more than once, too, by telling identically topped pizzas apart by the sauce smell.

I slowly backed away from them and went the opposite direction while making sure they weren't following me....

I guessed the dogs had startled a skunk that had gotten under the house and the smell was coming through the floor. The smell stayed very strong throughout the evening. Later on, we were watching a movie in bed with the dogs (they like to burrow under the covers) and when I moved the cover I was hit with a huge dose of skunk. It was the dogs and they must have taken a direct hit! By now it was in my bed and on all the furniture.  We looked up all the recipes for getting rid of the skunk smell and tried most of them, both homemade and stuff we got from the vet.  It took over a week to get most of the smell out of the house and every time the dogs got wet, it was back with a vengeance. It was probably a good month before it was completely gone. My research led me to conclude that there are two kinds of dogs...those that learn from their first encounter with a skunk and those that NEVER do.

It was immediately clear that something awful had happened, as we began to hold our breaths since simple breathing was causing us to gag. We reached for the light and turned it on, and there it was: our dog had had an accident right next to the door. Right in front of the door, in fact, so we could not even quickly open the door to escape the smell because then the door would spread the accident and make things even worse. Between gags, we brainstormed what we could do to exit the room and acquire the cleaning products we needed. Simply opening the door was not an option since the accident was right next to it and the door opened inwards. After what seemed like an eternity, we found some folders and papers in the room that we could do without, and we used this to brush the accident aside so that we could open the door and get the cleaning materials required.

I was twenty-five, so obviously I already knew what coffee smelled like, but I had never known it could smell so *good* (alas, I had not yet been to Portland, but that's another story). They roast on-premises there, and the scent of freshly-roasted coffee beans and lovingly crafted espresso was so much richer and more complex than the coffee smells I had been used to that it could scarcely be considered the same experience. The inside of a Starbucks smelled dead, but this smell was alive, sparkling with notes of spice and sweetness I had never associated with coffee before. I ordered an espresso, and inhaling the scent rising from the cup itself was the same experience, but an order of magnitude greater, the sort of aroma that drowns out all your other senses for one heavenly moment.",0,"rich, complex, earthy, bittersweet",-99,a memorable experience involving smell,questions about your favorite smells,Who was present when you had this experience?,160,4,positive,86.206897,0.285714,0,0.428571,0.5,0.333333,0,0.333333,0.333333,0,0.666667,4,4,1,0.208333,0.150943,0.296296,0.042553,0,0.367347,0.333333,0,48,4,25,0.05739,0.253743,0.367347,0.333333,25,163,40.75,19.02,87.73,0,58.9,12.88,6.75,5.52,0,0.61,0,0.61,6.13,9.2,11.04,9.2,8.59,0.61,0,3.07,11.04,7.36,1.84,4.29,2.45,0,2.45,0,0,0,3.07,3.07,0,0,0,0,19.63,3.68,0.61,1.23,0.61,2.45,0,6.13,3.07,8.59,0,0,0,4.91,0,0.61,0,4.29,10.43,1.23,3.07,6.13,0.61,1.23,3.68,0,1.23,0.61,1.84,0,0,0.61,3.07,7.98,0,0,0,0,3.07,0,0.61,0.61,1.84,16.56,3,3,5,4,Selected,Cluster 5 attractive -- caused an aha-moment,5 attractive 3 Happiness Well Being -> Energizing Cooling -> Soothing Peacefulness
